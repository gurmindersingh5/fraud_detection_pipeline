Fraud Detection Pipeline Using Spark Streaming, Kafka, and Cassandra

This project is a real-time fraud detection pipeline that uses Apache Spark Streaming to process transactional data coming 
from Kafka, applies a pre-trained machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions, and writes the predictions to 
Cassandra. The pipeline is designed to be scalable and efficient, capable of handling large volumes of streaming data with 
low latency.

Architecture

Kafka: Acts as a message broker, streaming transactional data to the Spark job.
Spark Streaming: Processes the real-time data, performs feature engineering, and applies a machine learning model to detect fraud.
Cassandra: Stores the predictions made by the model, allowing for fast retrieval and analysis.
Pre-Trained Machine Learning Model: A Logistic Regression model trained to detect fraudulent transactions.


Technologies Used

Apache Spark: For real-time data processing and machine learning.
Kafka: As a distributed streaming platform.
Cassandra: For storing predictions.
Python: Programming language used for developing the Spark job.
scikit-learn: For training the Logistic Regression model.
Joblib: For model serialization and deserialization.


Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Java 8: Required for running Apache Spark.
Apache Spark 3.x: Install Spark on your local machine or cluster.
Apache Kafka: Set up Kafka and create the required topics.
Cassandra: Install Cassandra and create the necessary keyspace and tables.
Python 3.x: Install Python along with the required libraries.


Running the Pipeline

Start Kafka
Start the Kafka broker and ensure the transactions topic is ready to receive messages.


Run the Spark Streaming Job


Monitor the Output


You can monitor the predictions being written to Cassandra using cqlsh:
SELECT * FROM fraud_detection.predictions;


Challenges Faced
1. Handling Real-Time Data with Spark Streaming
Challenge: Processing data in real-time while maintaining low latency was a critical requirement.
Solution: Spark Streaming with Kafka integration was used to process data in micro-batches. Watermarking was applied to handle late data arrivals.
2. Feature Engineering in Streaming Context
Challenge: Implementing complex feature engineering like transaction frequency and average transaction amount in a streaming context.
Solution: Window functions and aggregations were used to calculate features based on a time window, ensuring that features were calculated correctly and efficiently.
3. Model Integration
Challenge: Integrating a pre-trained machine learning model into a Spark Streaming job.
Solution: The model was serialized using Joblib and loaded into the Spark job for real-time predictions.
4. Data Storage in Cassandra
Challenge: Writing high-frequency predictions to Cassandra while ensuring data consistency and avoiding bottlenecks.
Solution: Cassandraâ€™s distributed nature and high write throughput made it suitable for storing real-time predictions.
5. Schema Evolution
Challenge: Adapting to potential changes in the incoming data schema.
Solution: Structured Streaming with schema inference was used to handle schema evolution gracefully.


Future Improvements
Model Updates: Implementing a mechanism to update the machine learning model periodically without interrupting the streaming job.
Anomaly Detection: Enhancing the model to detect more complex fraud patterns using advanced techniques like anomaly detection.
Monitoring and Alerting: Integrating real-time monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to anomalies in the pipeline.
